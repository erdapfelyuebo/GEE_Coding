//Q3.5:
//I choose to analyze the capacity factor of Chongqing, a megacity (31mil people) in China.
//The first CF and the second CF are computed in different ways:
//The first one is computed on the basis of the yearly average of the temperature in Chongqing 
//whereas the second one is computed based on the 3-hourly data of the temperature and the shortwave 
//irradiation. Therefore, the first one shows the overall capacity for a solar panel to produce solar 
//energy on a yearly basis whereas the second one evaluates the peak time and the low-tide time when a 
//solar panel produces solar energy for electricity in Chongqing.
//Based on the time series of the CF chart, it is shown that most of the time in 2010, the capacity factor is at least
//below 0.6 and the peak time is between late June and August. On the other hand, the low tide time is in
//October, December. In my opinion, the CF is mostly low due to Chongqing's topography. Chongqing is a mountain city and the mountains
//can capture the precipitation and get it trapped, which leads to very clouded skies. The clouds can
//reflect the shortwave back and that makes the yearly average temperature and the yearly average shortwave irradiation
//fairly low. Besides, the mountains can keep the smog trapped in the city and that makes the solar radiation even more difficult
//to reach the city. The smog mainly comes from burning of coal for electricity according to Patel (n.d.). The burning of coal
//happens a lot more in wintertimes (Patel, n.d.). Because the smog has a blocking effect on the sunlight plus the fact that the clouds can do the 
//same, the CF looks extremely low in the chart. Therefore, unless a source other than solar energy can replace 
//the coal burning for electricity, for investors, solar energy is not worth investing in Chongqing.
